cd ai-image-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations
VITE_USE_WEBHOOK=false
VITE_WEBHOOK_URL=your-webhook-url
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash

## Configuration

### OpenAI API
By default, the application uses the OpenAI API directly. You'll need to:
1. Create an OpenAI account
2. Get an API key from the OpenAI dashboard
3. Add your API key in the application settings

### Webhook Mode
Alternatively, you can use a custom webhook:
1. Set `VITE_USE_WEBHOOK=true` in `.env`
2. Set `VITE_WEBHOOK_URL` to your webhook endpoint
3. Ensure your webhook handles the following request format:
```json
{
  "type": "tradingcard|broll|iconset",
  "parameters": {
    // Generator-specific parameters
  },
  "colorsString": "color1 to color2",
  "openai_image_model": "gpt-image-1",
  "number_of_images": 1,
  "size_of_image": "1024x1024",
