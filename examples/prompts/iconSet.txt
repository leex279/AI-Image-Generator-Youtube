Create a cohesive and visually stunning set of icons within a single image, laid out in a grid. The icons should be for: {{ $json.body.parameters.icons }}. All icons should be consistent in form, lighting, and design, optimized for {{ $json.body.parameters.use_case }}. Each icon should be centered within its grid cell, clean, and easy to recognize at a glance. The overall icon design style is {{ $json.body.parameters.style }}. Apply the chosen aesthetic consistently across all icons. Icons should feature smooth edges, scalable design logic, and depth or lighting consistent with the style. The icons should appear premium and modern, fitting seamlessly into high-end UI/UX environments. Color palette is based on {{ $json.body.parameters.color_scheme }}. Use accent colors sparingly but effectively, ensuring high readability and visual balance. For each icon:  The name of the icon should be displayed underneath it  Each icon should be clearly separated from others in the grid layout  All icons should follow these guidelines:  Be centered and clean with adequate spacing  Match the chosen theme and color scheme  Have no background or a soft ambient glow depending on style  Feature lighting and shadows that add subtle depth (if style allows)  Include the following custom instructions from the user: {{ $json.body.parameters.custom_instructions }} 
Create this as a single image showing all icons in a grid layout. The entire image should feel cohesive, modern, and professionalâ€”suitable for futuristic interfaces or themed UI sets.
